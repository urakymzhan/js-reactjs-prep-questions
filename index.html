        <h4>JavaScript Questions - Concepts</h4>

        <a href="#react"> GO TO REACT QUESTIONS </a>
      </div>

      <h3>What is functional programming?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Functional Programming produces programs by composing mathematical
        functions and avoids shared state & mutable data.
        <pre><code>Terms: Pure functions, Avoid side-effects, higher order functions</code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>
        What is asynchronous programming, and why is it important in
        JavaScript?
      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Synchronous programming means that, barring conditionals and function
        calls, code is executed sequentially from top-to-bottom, blocking on
        long-running tasks such as network requests and disk I/O.<br />
        Asynchronous programming means that the engine runs in an event loop.
        <br />When a blocking operation is needed, the request is started, and
        the code keeps running without blocking for the result. <br />When the
        response is ready, an interrupt is fired, which causes an event
        handler to be run, where the control flow continues.<br />
        In this way, a single program thread can handle many concurrent
        operations.<br />
        <pre><code>Terms: top-to-bottom, blocking, event loop</code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>
        What is a potential pitfall with using typeof bar === "object" to
        determine if bar is an object? How can this pitfall be avoided?
      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>typeof [] also an object. typeof null also an object</code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>
        What is NaN? What is its type? How can you reliably test if a value is
        equal to NaN?
      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
            NaN === NaN // ? why?
            isNaN();
          </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>
        How to you explain closure?
      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Closures is simply the ability of a function at the time of
        declaration to remember the references of variables and parameters on
        its current scope, on its parent function scope, on its parent's
        parent function scope until it reaches the global scope with the help
        of Scope Chain. Basically it is the Scope created when the function
        was declared. <br />
        Examples are a great way to explain closures.
        <pre><code>
            var globalVar = "global";
            var outerVar = "outer"

            function outerFunc(outerParam) {
              function innerFunc(innerParam) {
                console.log(globalVar, outerParam, innerParam);
              }
              return innerFunc;
            }

            const x = outerFunc(outerVar);
            outerVar = "outer-2";
            globalVar = "guess"
            x("inner");
          </code></pre>
        This will print "guess outer inner". The explanation for this is that
        when we invoke the outerFunc function and assigned the returned value
        the innerFunc function to the variable x, the outerParam will have a
        value of outer even though we assign a new value outer-2 to the
        outerVar variable because the reassignment happened after the
        invocation of the outer function and in that time when we invoke the
        outerFunc function it's look up the value of outerVar in the Scope
        Chain, the outerVar will have a value of "outer".<br />
        Now, when we invoke the x variable which have a reference to the
        innerFunc, the innerParam will have a value of inner because thats the
        value we pass in the invocation and the globalVar variable will have a
        value of guess because before the invocation of the x variable we
        assign a new value to the globalVar and at the time of invocation x
        the value of globalVar in the_Scope Chain_ is guess.
      </div>

      <h3>
        What is debounce?
      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Debouncing a function ensures that it doesn’t get called too
        frequently. Usually we don't write a custom debounce function and use
        the "lodash" version, which is great Example

      </div>

      <h3>
        The data types supported by JavaScript are?
      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
            Undefined
            Null
            Boolean
            String
            Symbol
            Number
            Object
          </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>
        Explain var, let, const?
      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        In Javascript one can define variables using the keywords var, let or
        const.
        <pre><code>
            var a=10;
            let b=20;
            const PI=3.14;
          </code></pre>
        <i>var:</i> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is
        limited to the “function” within which it is defined. If it is defined
        outside any function, the scope of the variable is global. var is
        “function scoped”.<br />
        <i>let:</i> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or
        “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} .
        “let” and “const” are“block scoped”.<br />
        <i>const:</i> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const”
        is limited to the block defined by curly braces. However if a variable
        is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned. “const” cannot
        be re-assigned to a new value. However it CAN be mutated.
      </div>

      <h3>
        What is the difference between the operators ‘==‘ & ‘===‘?
      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        === and !== are strict comparison operators: <br />

        JavaScript has both strict and type-converting equality comparison.
        For strict equality the objects being compared must have the same type
        and:<br />

        Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of
        characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding
        positions.<br />
        Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal (have
        the same number value). NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
        Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.<br />
        Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are
        false.<br />
        Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.<br />
        Null and Undefined types are == (but not ===). [I.e. (Null==Undefined)
        is true but (Null===Undefined) is false]<br />
        Example:
        <pre><code>
            0 == false   // true
            0 === false  // false, because they are of a different type
            1 == "1"     // true, automatic type conversion for value only
            1 === "1"    // false, because they are of a different type
            null == undefined // true
            null === undefined // false
            '0' == false // true
            '0' === false // false
          </code></pre>

      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        - not defined - instance is not declared and used;<br />
        - undefined - instance declared and used without its value.<br />
        <pre><code>
            alert(a) // Here a is not defined.

            alert(a); // Here a is undefined because javascript engine convert this code to
            var a=10

            var a;
            alert(a); // that's why `a` is defined here

      <h3>What is React?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        React is an open-source frontend JavaScript library which is used for
        building user interfaces especially for single page applications.<br />
        It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was
        created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook.<br />
        React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on
        Instagram in 2012.
      </div>

      <h3>What are the major features of React?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre>
            <code>
                  The major features of React are:
                      - It uses VirtualDOM instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
                      - Supports server-side rendering.
                      - Follows Unidirectional data flow or data binding.
                      - Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.
                  </code>
              </pre>
      </div>

      <h3>What is JSX?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  JSX is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript (the acronym stands for JavaScript XML).
                  Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the React.createElement() function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.
                  In the example below text inside &lt;h1&gt; tag is returned as JavaScript function to the render function.

                      class App extends React.Component {
                          render() {
                              return(
                                &lt;div&gt;
                                  &lt;h1&gt;{'Welcome to React world!'}&lt;/h1&gt;
                                &lt;/div&gt;
                              )
                          }
                      }
              </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>What is the difference between Element and Component?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        - An Element is a plain object describing what you want to appear on
        the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components.<br />
        - Elements can contain other Elements in their props.<br />
        - Creating a React element is cheap.<br />
        - Once an element is created, it is never mutated.<br />
        - The object representation of React Element would be as follows:<br />
        <pre><code>
                  const element = React.createElement(
                    'div',
                    {id: 'login-btn'},
                    'Login'
                  )
                  - The above React.createElement() function returns an object:

                  {
                    type: 'div',
                    props: {
                      children: 'Login',
                      id: 'login-btn'
                    }
                  }
                  - And finally it renders to the DOM using ReactDOM.render():
                    &lt;div&gt;Login&lt;/div&gt;

                  - Whereas a component can be declared in several different ways.
                  - It can be a class with a render() method. Alternatively, in simple cases, it can be defined as a function. In either case, it takes props as an input, and returns a JSX tree as the output:

                  const Button = ({ onLogin }) =>
                  &lt;div id={'login-btn'} onClick={onLogin}&gt;Login&lt;/div&gt;
                  Then JSX gets transpiled to a React.createElement() function tree:

                  const Button = ({ onLogin }) => React.createElement(
                    'div',
                    { id: 'login-btn', onClick: onLogin },
                    'Login'
                  )
              </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>How to create components in React?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  - There are two possible ways to create a component.

                  ----------------
                  1. Function Components: This is the simplest way to create a component.
                  - Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as first parameter and return React elements:

                  function Greeting({ message }) {
                    return &lt;h1&gt;{`Hello, ${message}`}&lt;/h1&gt;

                  }
                  ----------------
                  2. Class Components: You can also use ES6 class to define a component.
                  The above function component can be written as:

                  class Greeting extends React.Component {
                    render() {
                      return &lt;h1&gt;{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}&lt;/h1&gt;
                    }
                  }

      <h3>When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        If the component needs state or lifecycle methods then use class
        component otherwise use function component.<br />
        However, from React 16.8 with the addition of Hooks, you could use
        state , lifecycle methods and other features that were only available
        in class component right in your function component.
      </div>

      <h3>What are Pure Components?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  React.PureComponent is exactly the same as React.Component except that it handles the shouldComponentUpdate() method for you.
                  When props or state changes, PureComponent will do a shallow comparison on both props and state.
                  Component on the other hand won't compare current props and state to next out of the box.
                  Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever shouldComponentUpdate is called.
              </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>What is state in React?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        - State of a component is an object that holds some information that
        may change over the lifetime of the component.<br />
        - We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and
        minimize the number of stateful components.<br />

        - Let's create an user component with message state,
        <pre><code>
                  class User extends React.Component {
                      constructor(props) {
                          super(props)

                          this.state = {
                          message: 'Welcome to React world'
                          }
                      }

                      render() {
                          return (
                          &lt;div&gt;
                              &lt;h1&gt;{this.state.message}&lt;/h1&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;
                          )
                      }
                  }
              </code></pre>
        <img src="./images/state.jpg" />

        - State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by
        the component. i.e,<br />
        - It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns
        and sets it.
      </div>

      <h3>What are props in React?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Props are inputs to components. They are single values or objects
        containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation
        using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. They are
        data passed down from a parent component to a child component.<br />

        The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following
        component functionality:<br />

        Pass custom data to your component.<br />
        Trigger state changes.<br />
        Use via this.props.reactProp inside component's render() method.<br />
        For example, let us create an element with reactProp property:
        <pre><code>
                  &lt;Element reactProp={'1'} /&gt;

                  This reactProp (or whatever you came up with) name then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.
                  props.reactProp
              </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>What is the difference between state and props?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Both props and state are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them
        hold information that influences the output of render, they are
        different in their functionality with respect to component.<br />
        Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters
        whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables
        declared within a function.
      </div>

      <h3>Why should we not update the state directly?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  If you try to update state directly then it won't re-render the component.

                  // Wrong
                  this.state.message = 'Hello world'
                  Instead use setState() method. It schedules an update to a component's state object.
                  When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

                  // Correct
                  this.setState({ message: 'Hello World' })
                  Note: You can directly assign to the state object either in constructor or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax
              </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>
        What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of setState()?
      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  The callback function is invoked when setState finished and the component gets rendered. Since setState() is asynchronous the callback function is used for any post action.

                  Note: It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather than this callback function.

                  setState({ name: 'John' }, () => console.log('The name has updated and component re-rendered'))
              </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>What is the difference between HTML and React event handling?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Below are some of the main differences between HTML and React event
        handling,
        <pre><code>
                      1. In HTML, the event name should be in lowercase:
                          &lt;button onclick='activateLasers()'&gt;
                          - Whereas in React it follows camelCase convention:

                          &lt;button onClick={activateLasers}&gt;

                      2. In HTML, you can return false to prevent default behavior:
                          &lt;a href='#' onclick='console.log("The link was clicked."); return false;' /&gt;
                          - Whereas in React you must call preventDefault() explicitly:

                          function handleClick(event) {
                          event.preventDefault()
                          console.log('The link was clicked.')
                          }

                      3. In HTML, you need to invoke the function by appending () Whereas in react you should not append () with the function name. (refer "activateLasers" function in the first point for example)
              </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>How to bind methods or event handlers in JSX callbacks?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        There are 3 possible ways to achieve this:
        <pre><code>
                  1. Binding in Constructor: In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same thing applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor.

                      class Component extends React.Componenet {
                          constructor(props) {
                              super(props)
                              this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
                          }

                          handleClick() {
                              // ...
                          }
                      }

                  2. Public class fields syntax: If you don't like to use bind approach then public class fields syntax can be used to correctly bind callbacks.

                      handleClick = () => {
                          console.log('this is:', this)
                      }
                      &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt;
                          {'Click me'}
                      &lt;/button&gt;

                  3. Arrow functions in callbacks: You can use arrow functions directly in the callbacks.

                      &lt;button onClick={(event) => this.handleClick(event)}&gt;
                          {'Click me'}
                      &lt;/button&gt;
              </code>
          </pre>
        Note: If the callback is passed as prop to child components, those
        components might do an extra re-rendering.<br />
        In those cases, it is preferred to go with .bind() or public class
        fields syntax approach considering performance.
      </div>

      <h3>How to pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        You can use an arrow function to wrap around an event handler and pass
        parameters:
        <pre><code>
                      &lt;button onClick={() => this.handleClick(id)} /&gt;
                  This is an equivalent to calling .bind:

                      &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} /&gt;
                  Apart from these two approaches, you can also pass arguments to a function which is defined as array function

                      &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick(id)} /&gt;
                      handleClick = (id) => () => {
                          console.log("Hello, your ticket number is", id)
                      };
              </code></pre>

      <h3>What are synthetic events in React?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  SyntheticEvent is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event.
                  It's API is same as the browser's native event, including stopPropagation() and preventDefault(), except the events work identically across all browsers.

      </div>

      <h3>What are inline conditional expressions?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        You can use either if statements or ternary expressions which are
        available from JS to conditionally render expressions.<br />
        Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX
        by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical
        operator &&.
        <pre><code>
                      &lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;
                      {
                          messages.length > 0 && !isLogin?
                          &lt;h2&gt;
                              You have {messages.length} unread messages.
                          &lt;/h2&gt;
                          :
                          &lt;h2&gt;
                              You don't have unread messages.
                          &lt;/h2&gt;
                      }
              </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>
        What is "key" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of
        elements?
      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        A key is a special string attribute you should include when creating
        arrays of elements.<br />
        Key prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or
        are removed.<br />
        Most often we use ID from our data as key:
        <pre><code>
                      const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
                      &lt;li key={todo.id}&gt;
                          {todo.text}
                      &lt;/li&gt;
                      )

                  When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:

                      const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
                      &lt;li key={index}&gt;
                          {todo.text}
                      &lt;/li&gt;
                      )
              </code></pre>
        Note:<br />
        1. Using indexes for keys is not recommended if the order of items may
        change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues
        with component state.<br />
        2. If you extract list item as separate component then apply keys on
        list component instead of li tag.<br />
        3. There will be a warning message in the console if the key prop is
        not present on list items.<br />
      </div>

      <h3>What is the use of refs?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        The ref is used to return a reference to the element.<br />
        They should be avoided in most cases, however, they can be useful when
        you need a direct access to the DOM element or an instance of a
        component.
      </div>

      <h3>How to create refs?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        There are two approaches
        <pre><code>
                  1. This is a recently added approach. Refs are created using React.createRef() method and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. In order to use refs throughout the component, just assign the ref to the instance property within constructor.

                      class MyComponent extends React.Component {
                      constructor(props) {
                          super(props)
                          this.myRef = React.createRef()
                      }
                      render() {
                          return &lt;div ref={this.myRef} /&gt;
                      }
                      }

                  2. You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component's input element accessed as follows,

                      class SearchBar extends Component {
                      constructor(props) {
                          super(props);
                          this.txtSearch = null;
                          this.state = { term: '' };
                          this.setInputSearchRef = e => {
                              this.txtSearch = e;
                          }
                      }
                      onInputChange(event) {
                          this.setState({ term: this.txtSearch.value });
                      }
                      render() {
                          return (
                              &lt;input
                                  value={this.state.term}
                                  onChange={this.onInputChange.bind(this)}
                                  ref={this.setInputSearchRef} /&gt;
                          );
                      }
                      }
                  3. You can also use refs in function components using closures.

        Note: You can also use inline ref callbacks even though it is not a
        recommended approach

      <h3>What are forward refs?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Ref forwarding is a feature that lets some components take a ref they
        receive, and pass it further down to a child.
        <pre><code>
                  const ButtonElement = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
                      &lt;button ref={ref} className="CustomButton"&gt;
                          {props.children}
                      &lt;/button&gt;
                  ));

                  // Create ref to the DOM button:
                  const ref = React.createRef();
                  &lt;ButtonElement ref={ref}&gt;{'Forward Ref'}&lt;/ButtonElement&gt;

      <h3>What is Virtual DOM?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of Real DOM.
                  The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM.
                  It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen.
                  This entire process is called reconciliation.
              </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>How Virtual DOM works?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        The Virtual DOM works in three simple steps.

        <pre><code>
                      1. Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation.

                      <img src="./images/vdom1.png"/>

                      2. Then the difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is calculated.

                      <img src="./images/vdom2.png"/>

                      3. Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will be updated with only the things that have actually changed.

      <h3>What are controlled components?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  A component that controls the input elements within the forms on subsequent user input is called Controlled Component, i.e, every state mutation will have an associated handler function.

                  For example, to write all the names in uppercase letters, we use handleChange as below,

                      handleChange(event) {
                      this.setState({value: event.target.value.toUpperCase()})
                      }

      <h3>What are uncontrolled components?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  The Uncontrolled Components are the ones that store their own state internally, and you query the DOM using a ref to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.

                  In the below UserProfile component, the name input is accessed using ref.

                      class UserProfile extends React.Component {
                      constructor(props) {
                          super(props)
                          this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this)
                          this.input = React.createRef()
                      }

                      handleSubmit(event) {
                          alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.input.current.value)
                          event.preventDefault()
                      }

                      render() {

      <h3>What are the different phases of component lifecycle?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:

                      1. Mounting: The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from constructor(), getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), and componentDidMount() lifecycle methods.

                      2. Updating: In this phase, the component get updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from setState() or forceUpdate(). This phase covers getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and componentDidUpdate() lifecycle methods.

                      3. Unmounting: In this last phase, the component is not needed and get unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method.

                  It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows

                      1. Render The component will render without any side-effects. This applies for Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.

                      2. Pre-commit Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate().

                      3. Commit React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively componentDidMount() for mounting, componentDidUpdate() for updating, and componentWillUnmount() for unmounting.

        <pre><code>
                  Before React 16.3

                      componentWillMount: Executed before rendering and is used for App level configuration in your root component.
                      componentDidMount: Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.
                      componentWillReceiveProps: Executed when particular prop updates to trigger state transitions.
                      shouldComponentUpdate: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.
                      componentWillUpdate: Executed before re-rendering the component when there are props & state changes confirmed by shouldComponentUpdate() which returns true.
                      componentDidUpdate: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
                      componentWillUnmount: It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

                  React 16.3+

                      getDerivedStateFromProps: Invoked right before calling render() and is invoked on every render. This exists for rare use cases where you need derived state. Worth reading if you need derived state.
                      componentDidMount: Executed after first rendering and here all AJAX requests, DOM or state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.
                      shouldComponentUpdate: Determines if the component will be updated or not. By default it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after state or props are updated, you can return false value. It is a great place to improve performance as it allows you to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.
                      getSnapshotBeforeUpdate: Executed right before rendered output is committed to the DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into componentDidUpdate(). This is useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position.
                      componentDidUpdate: Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. This will not fire if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.
                      componentWillUnmount It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.

      <h3>What are Higher-Order Components?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
                  Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature.

                  We call them pure components because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.

                      const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent)

                  HOC can be used for many use cases:
                      - Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction.
                      - Render hijacking.
                      - State abstraction and manipulation.
                      - Props manipulation.

                  Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

                  For example, authenticated user, locale preference, UI theme need to be accessed in the application by many components.

                      const {Provider, Consumer} = React.createContext(defaultValue)

      <h3>What is children prop?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  Children is a prop (this.prop.children) that allow you to pass components as data to other components,
                  just like any other prop you use. Component tree put between component's opening and closing tag will be passed to that component as children prop.

                  There are a number of methods available in the React API to work with this prop.
                  These include React.Children.map, React.Children.forEach, React.Children.count, React.Children.only, React.Children.toArray.

                  A simple usage of children prop looks as below,

                  const MyDiv = React.createClass({
                    render: function() {
                      return &lt;div&gt;{this.props.children}&lt;/div&gt;
                    }
                  })

                  ReactDOM.render(
                      &lt;MyDiv&gt;
                          &lt;span&gt;{'Hello'}&lt;/span&gt;
                          &lt;span&gt;{'World'}&lt;/span&gt;

      <h3>
        What is the purpose of using super constructor with props argument?
      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  A child class constructor cannot make use of this reference until super() method
                  has been called. The same applies for ES6 sub-classes as well.
                  The main reason of passing props parameter to super() call is to access this.props
                  in your child constructors.

                  Passing props:

                      class MyComponent extends React.Component {
                          constructor(props) {
                              super(props)

                              console.log(this.props) // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
                          }
                      }

                  Not passing props:

                      class MyComponent extends React.Component {
                          constructor(props) {
                              super()

                              console.log(this.props) // prints undefined

                              // but props parameter is still available
                              console.log(props) // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
                          }

                          render() {
                              // no difference outside constructor
                              console.log(this.props) // prints { name: 'John', age: 42 }
                          }
                      }
                  The above code snippets reveals that this.props is different only within the constructor.
                  It would be the same outside the constructor.

                  When they are not equal, React will update the DOM. This process is called reconciliation.

      <h3>Is lazy function supports named exports?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  No, currently React.lazy function supports default exports only.
                  If you would like to import modules which are named exports, you can create an
                  intermediate module that reexports it as the default.
                  It also ensures that tree shaking keeps working and don’t pull unused components.
                  Let's take a component file which exports multiple named components,

                  // MoreComponents.js
                      export const SomeComponent = /* ... */;
                      export const UnusedComponent = /* ... */;

                  and reexport MoreComponents.js components in an intermediate file IntermediateComponent.js

                  // IntermediateComponent.js
                      export { SomeComponent as default } from "./MoreComponents.js";

                  Now you can import the module using lazy function as below,

                      import React, { lazy } from 'react';
                      const SomeComponent = lazy(() => import("./IntermediateComponent.js"));

                      - Some CSS mechanisms like Flexbox and CSS Grid have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.

      <h3>What are stateless components?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  If the behaviour is independent of its state then it can be a stateless component.
                  You can use either a function or a class for creating stateless components.
                  But unless you need to use a lifecycle hook in your components, you should go for function components.
                  There are a lot of benefits if you decide to use function components here; they are easy to write, understand, and test, a little faster, and you can avoid the this keyword altogether.

      <h3>What are stateful components?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  If the behaviour of a component is dependent on the state of the component then it can be termed as stateful component. These stateful components are always class components and have a state that gets initialized in the constructor.

                      class App extends Component {
                          constructor(props) {
                              super(props)
                              this.state = { count: 0 }
                          }

                          render() {
                              // ...
                          }

                  React 16.8 Update:

                  Hooks let you use state and other React features without writing classes.

                  The Equivalent Functional Component

                       import React, {useState} from 'react';

                         const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

                         return (
                           // JSX
                         )

      <h3>How to apply validation on props in React?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  When the application is running in development mode,
                  React will automatically check all props that we set on components to make sure they have correct type. If the type is incorrect, React will generate warning messages in the console. It's disabled in production mode due to performance impact.
                  The mandatory props are defined with isRequired.

                  The set of predefined prop types:

                  PropTypes.number
                  PropTypes.string
                  PropTypes.array
                  PropTypes.object
                  PropTypes.func
                  PropTypes.node
                  PropTypes.element
                  PropTypes.bool
                  PropTypes.symbol
                  PropTypes.any

                  We can define propTypes for User component as below:

                  import React from 'react'
                  import PropTypes from 'prop-types'

                  class User extends React.Component {
                    static propTypes = {
                      name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
                      age: PropTypes.number.isRequired
                    }

                    render() {
                      return (
                          &lt;&gt;
                              &lt;h1&gt;{`Welcome, ${this.props.name}`}&lt;/h1&gt;
                              &lt;h2&gt;{`Age, ${this.props.age}`}&lt;/h2&gt;
                          &lt;/&gt;
                      )
                    }
                  }

                  Note: In React v15.5 PropTypes were moved from React.PropTypes to prop-types library.

                      1. Increases the application's performance with Virtual DOM.
                      2. JSX makes code easy to read and write.
                      3. It renders both on client and server side (SSR).
                      4. Easy to integrate with frameworks (Angular, Backbone) since it is only a view library.
                      5. Easy to write unit and integration tests with tools such as Jest.

                      3. Integrating React into a traditional MVC framework requires some additional configuration.
                      4. The code complexity increases with inline templating and JSX.
                      5. Too many smaller components leading to over engineering or boilerplate.

      <h3>What are error boundaries in React v16?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  Error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree,
                  log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

                  A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines a new lifecycle method called componentDidCatch(error, info) or static getDerivedStateFromError() :

                      class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
                          constructor(props) {
                              super(props)
                              this.state = { hasError: false }
                          }

                          componentDidCatch(error, info) {
                              // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
                              logErrorToMyService(error, info)
                          }

                          static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
                              // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
                              return { hasError: true };
                          }

                          render() {
                              if (this.state.hasError) {
                                  // You can render any custom fallback UI
                                  return &lt;h1&gt;{'Something went wrong.'}&lt;/h1&gt;
                              }
                              return this.props.children
                          }
                      }

                  After that use it as a regular component:

                  &lt;ErrorBoundary&gt;
                      &lt;MyWidget /&gt;

                  ReactDOM.render(element, container[, callback])

                  If the optional callback is provided, it will be executed after the component is rendered or updated.

      <h3>What is ReactDOMServer?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  The ReactDOMServer object enables you to render components to static markup (typically used on node server). This object is mainly used for server-side rendering (SSR). The following methods can be used in both the server and browser environments:

                      renderToString()
                      renderToStaticMarkup()

                  For example, you generally run a Node-based web server like Express, Hapi, or Koa, and you call renderToString to render your root component to a string, which you then send as response.

                      // using Express
                      import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server'
                      import MyPage from './MyPage'

                      app.get('/', (req, res) => {

                      res.write(renderToString(&lt;MyPage/&gt;))
                      res.write('&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;')

      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  The dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute is React's replacement for using innerHTML in the browser DOM. Just like innerHTML, it is risky to use this attribute considering cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. You just need to pass a __html object as key and HTML text as value.

                  In this example MyComponent uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute for setting HTML markup:

                      function createMarkup() {
                      return { __html: 'First &middot; Second' }
                      }

                      function MyComponent() {
                      return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup()} />

      <h3>How to use styles in React?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  The style attribute accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties rather than a CSS string.
                  This is consistent with the DOM style JavaScript property, is more efficient, and prevents XSS security holes.

                      const divStyle = {
                      color: 'blue',
                      backgroundImage: 'url(' + imgUrl + ')'
                      };

                      function HelloWorldComponent() {
                      return &lt;div style={divStyle}&gt;Hello World!&lt;/div&gt;
                      }

                  Style keys are camelCased in order to be consistent with accessing the properties on DOM nodes in JavaScript (e.g. node.style.backgroundImage).

      <h3>What is the impact of indexes as keys?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Keys should be stable, predictable, and unique so that React can keep
        track of elements.
        <pre><code>


                  In the below code snippet each element's key will be based on ordering, rather than tied to the data that is being represented.
                  This limits the optimizations that React can do.

                      {todos.map((todo, index) =>
                          &lt;Todo
                              {...todo}

                          /&gt;
                      )}

                  If you use element data for unique key, assuming todo.id is unique to this list and stable,
                  React would be able to reorder elements without needing to reevaluate them as much.

                      {todos.map((todo) =>
                          &lt;Todo {...todo}

      <h3>Is it good to use setState() in componentWillMount() method?</h3>

                  It is recommended to avoid async initialization in componentWillMount() lifecycle
                  method. componentWillMount() is invoked immediately before mounting occurs.
                  It is called before render(), therefore setting state in this method will not trigger
                  a re-render. Avoid introducing any side-effects or subscriptions in this method.
                  We need to make sure async calls for component initialization happened in componentDidMount() instead of componentWillMount().

                  componentDidMount() {
                    axios.get(`api/todos`)

      <h3>What will happen if you use props in initial state?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        If the props on the component are changed without the component being
        refreshed, the new prop value will never be displayed because the
        constructor function will never update the current state of the
        component.<br />
        The initialization of state from props only runs when the component is
        first created.
        <pre><code>

                  The below component won't display the updated input value:

                  class MyComponent extends React.Component {
                    constructor(props) {
                      super(props)

                      this.state = {

                  Using props inside render method will update the value:

        some state. JSX does not render false or undefined, so you can use
        conditional short-circuiting to render a given part of your component
        only if a certain condition is true.
        <pre><code>


                      const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => (
                          &lt;div&gt;
                              &lt;h2&gt;{name}&lt;/h2&gt;
                              {address &&
                                  &lt;p&gt;{address}&lt;/p&gt;
                              }
                          &lt;/div&gt;
                      )

                  If you need an if-else condition then use ternary operator.

                      const MyComponent = ({ name, address }) => (
                          &lt;div&gt;
                              &lt;h2&gt;{name}&lt;/h2&gt;
                              {address
                              ? &lt;p&gt;{address}&lt;/p&gt;
                              : &lt;p&gt;{'Address is not available'}&lt;/p&gt;

      <h3>Why we need to be careful when spreading props on DOM elements?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  When we spread props we run into the risk of adding unknown HTML attributes, which is a bad practice.
                  Instead we can use prop destructuring with ...rest operator, so it will add only required props.

                  For example,

                      const ComponentA = () =>
                          &lt;ComponentB isDisplay={true} className={'componentStyle'} /&gt;

                      const ComponentB = ({ isDisplay, ...domProps }) =>
                          &lt;div {...domProps}&gt;{'ComponentB'}&lt;/div&gt;

      <h3>How you implement Server Side Rendering or SSR?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  React is already equipped to handle rendering on Node servers.
                  A special version of the DOM renderer is available, which follows the same pattern as on the client side.

                      import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server'
                      import App from './App'

                      ReactDOMServer.renderToString(&lt;App /&gt;)

                  This method will output the regular HTML as a string, which can be then placed inside a page body as part of the server response. On the client side,
                  React detects the pre-rendered content and seamlessly picks up where it left off.

                      # Installation
                      $ npm install -g create-react-app

                      # Create new project
                      $ create-react-app todo-app
                      $ cd todo-app

                      # Build, test and run

                  It includes everything we need to build a React app:

                      - React, JSX, ES6, and Flow syntax support.
                      - Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
                      - Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need -webkit- or other prefixes.
                      - A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
                      - A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
                      - A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.

      <h3>Why we need to pass a function to setState()?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  The reason behind for this is that setState() is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after setState() is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling setState() since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to setState(), with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of setState().

                  Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.

                      // assuming this.state.count === 0
                      this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
                      this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
                      this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })
                      // this.state.count === 1, not 3

                  If we pass a function to setState(), the count gets incremented correctly.

                      this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
                      count: prevState.count + props.increment
                      }))
                      // this.state.count === 3 as expected
                      (OR)

                  Why function is preferred over object for setState()?
                  React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance. Because this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

                  This counter example will fail to update as expected:

                      // Wrong
                      this.setState({
                      counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
                      })
                      The preferred approach is to call setState() with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.

                      // Correct
                      this.setState((prevState, props) => ({
                      counter: prevState.counter + props.increment
                      }))

      <h3>Why should component names start with capital letter?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  If you are rendering your component using JSX, the name of that component has to begin with a capital letter otherwise React will throw an error as unrecognized tag. This convention is because only HTML elements and SVG tags can begin with a lowercase letter.

                      class SomeComponent extends Component {
                          // Code goes here
                      }

                      You can define component class which name starts with lowercase letter, but when it's imported it should have capital letter. Here lowercase is fine:

                      class myComponent extends Component {
                          render() {
                              return &lt;div /&gt;
                          }
                      }

                  export default myComponent
                  While when imported in another file it should start with capital letter:

                  import MyComponent from './MyComponent'

                      class MyComponent extends React.Component {
                          constructor(props) {
                              super(props)

                          }
                      }
                      Using React.createClass():

                      const MyComponent = React.createClass({
                          getInitialState() {
                              return { /* initial state */ }
                          }
                      })

                      component.forceUpdate(callback)

                      }
                      Using super():

      <h3>Why you can't update props in React?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  The React philosophy is that props should be immutable and top-down.
                  This means that a parent can send any prop values to a child, but the child can't modify received props.

      <h3>What are the possible ways of updating objects in state?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  Calling setState() with an object to merge with state:

                      1. Using Object.assign() to create a copy of the object:

                          const user = Object.assign({}, this.state.user, { age: 42 })
                          this.setState({ user })
                          Using spread operator:

                          const user = { ...this.state.user, age: 42 }
                          this.setState({ user })

                      2. Calling setState() with a function:

                          this.setState(prevState => ({
                          user: {
                              ...prevState.user,
                              age: 42
                          }
                          }))

      <h3>How to update a component every second?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  You need to use setInterval() to trigger the change, but you also need to clear the timer when the component unmounts to prevent errors and memory leaks.

                      componentDidMount() {
                          this.interval = setInterval(() => this.setState({ time: Date.now() }), 1000)
                      }

                      componentWillUnmount() {
                          clearInterval(this.interval)
                      }

      <h3>What are the exceptions on React component naming?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        The component names should start with a uppercase letter but there are
        few exceptions on this convention. The lowercase tag names with a dot
        (property accessors) are still considered as valid component names.

        <pre><code>

                  For example the below tag can be compiled to a valid component,

                  render(){
                     return (
                          &lt;obj.component /&gt; // `React.createElement(obj.component)`
                        )
                  }

              </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>Why is a component constructor called only once?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        React's reconciliation algorithm assumes that without any information
        to the contrary, if a custom component appears in the same place on
        subsequent renders, it's the same component as before, so reuses the
        previous instance rather than creating a new one.
      </div>

      <h3>How to programmatically trigger click event in React?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        You could use the ref prop to acquire a reference to the underlying
        HTMLInputElement object through a callback, store the reference as a
        class property, then use that reference to later trigger a click from
        your event handlers using the HTMLElement.click method.<br />

        This can be done in two steps:
        <pre><code>

                  1. Create ref in render method:

                      &lt;input ref={input => this.inputElement = input} /&gt;

                  2. Apply click event in your event handler:

                      this.inputElement.click()

      <h3>Is it possible to use async/await in plain React?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        If you want to use async/await in React, you will need Babel<br />

      <h3>What are the popular packages for animation?</h3>

      </div>

      <h3>What is the benefit of styles modules?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        It is recommended to avoid hard coding style values in components.<br />
        Any values that are likely to be used across different UI components
        should be extracted into their own modules.<br />

        For example, these styles could be extracted into a separate
        component:
        <pre><code>
                      export const colors = {
                          white,
                          black,
                          blue
                      }

                      export const space = [
                          0,
                          8,
                          16,
                          32,
                          64
                      ]

                  And then imported individually in other components:

                      import { space, colors } from './styles'

      <h3>What are the popular React-specific linters?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        ESLint is a popular JavaScript linter. There are plugins available
        that analyse specific code styles. One of the most common for React is
        an npm package called eslint-plugin-react.<br />
        By default, it will check a number of best practices, with rules
        checking things from keys in iterators to a complete set of prop
        types.<br />

        Another popular plugin is eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, which will help fix
        common issues with accessibility.<br />
        As JSX offers slightly different syntax to regular HTML, issues with
        alt text and tabindex, for example, will not be picked up by regular
        plugins.

      <h3>What are render props?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Render Props is a simple technique for sharing code between components
        using a prop whose value is a function.<br />
        The below component uses render prop which returns a React element.
        <pre><code>
                      &lt;DataProvider render={data => (
                          &lt;h1&gt;{`Hello ${data.target}`}&lt;/h1&gt;
                      )}/&gt;
              </code></pre>
        Libraries such as React Router and DownShift are using this pattern.

      <h4>ReactJS Questions - Redux</h4>

      <h3>What is Redux?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps based on
        the Flux design pattern.<br />
        Redux can be used together with React, or with any other view library.
        It is tiny (about 2kB) and has no dependencies.
      </div>

      <h3>What are the core principles of Redux?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Redux follows three fundamental principles:
        <pre><code>
                      1. Single source of truth: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.
                      2. State is read-only: The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.
                      3. Changes are made with pure functions: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state.

              </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>What are the downsides of Redux compared to Flux?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Instead of saying downsides we can say that there are few compromises
        of using Redux over Flux.<br />
        Those are as follows:
        <pre><code>
                      1. You will need to learn to avoid mutations: Flux is un-opinionated about mutating data, but Redux doesn't like mutations and many packages complementary to Redux assume you never mutate the state. You can enforce this with dev-only packages like redux-immutable-state-invariant, Immutable.js, or instructing your team to write non-mutating code.
                      2. You're going to have to carefully pick your packages: While Flux explicitly doesn't try to solve problems such as undo/redo, persistence, or forms, Redux has extension points such as middleware and store enhancers, and it has spawned a rich ecosystem.
                      3. There is no nice Flow integration yet: Flux currently lets you do very impressive static type checks which Redux doesn't support yet.

      <h3>
        What is the difference between mapStateToProps() and
        mapDispatchToProps()?
      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  mapStateToProps() is a utility which helps your component get updated state
                  (which is updated by some other components):

                      const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
                          return {
                              todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter)
                          }
                      }

                  mapDispatchToProps() is a utility which will help your component to fire an
                  action event (dispatching action which may cause change of application state):

                      const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
                          return {
                              onTodoClick: (id) => {
                              dispatch(toggleTodo(id))
                              }
                          }
                      }

                  Recommend always using the “object shorthand” form for the mapDispatchToProps

                  Redux wrap it in another function that looks like (…args) => dispatch(onTodoClick(…args)),
                  and pass that wrapper function as a prop to your component.

                      const mapDispatchToProps = ({
                          onTodoClick
                      })

      <h3>Can I dispatch an action in reducer?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Dispatching an action within a reducer is an anti-pattern.<br />
        Your reducer should be without side effects, simply digesting the
        action payload and returning a new state object.<br />
        Adding listeners and dispatching actions within the reducer can lead
        to chained actions and other side effects.

      <div class="answer">

                  store = createStore(myReducer)

                  1. DOM manipulation is very expensive which causes applications to behave slow and inefficient.
                  2. Due to circular dependencies, a complicated model was created around models and views.
                  3. Lot of data changes happens for collaborative applications(like Google Docs).

      <h3>Are there any similarities between Redux and RxJS?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        These libraries are very different for very different purposes, but
        there are some vague similarities.<br />

        Redux is a tool for managing state throughout the application. It is
        usually used as an architecture for UIs. Think of it as an alternative
        to (half of) Angular.<br />
        RxJS is a reactive programming library. It is usually used as a tool
        to accomplish asynchronous tasks in JavaScript. Think of it as an
        alternative to Promises.<br />
        Redux uses the Reactive paradigm because the Store is reactive. The
        Store observes actions from a distance, and changes itself. RxJS also
        uses the Reactive paradigm, but instead of being an architecture, it
        gives you basic building blocks, Observables, to accomplish this
        pattern.

      <h3>How to dispatch an action on load?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  You can dispatch an action in componentDidMount() method and in render() method you can verify the data.

                      componentDidMount() {
                          this.props.fetchData()

      <h3>How to use connect() from React Redux?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  You need to follow two steps to use your store in your container:

                      1. Use mapStateToProps(): It maps the state variables from your store to the props that you specify.

                      2. Connect the above props to your container:
                          The object returned by the mapStateToProps function is connected to the container.
                          You can import connect() from react-redux.

                          import React from 'react'
                          import { connect } from 'react-redux'

                  For example, let us take rootReducer() to return the initial state after USER_LOGOUT action.
                  As we know, reducers are supposed to return the initial state when they are called with undefined as the first argument, no matter the action.

                      const appReducer = combineReducers({
                      /* your app's top-level reducers */
                      })

                      const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
                      if (action.type === 'USER_LOGOUT') {
                          state = undefined
                      }

                      return appReducer(state, action)
                      }

                  In case of using redux-persist, you may also need to clean your storage.
                  redux-persist keeps a copy of your state in a storage engine.
                  First, you need to import the appropriate storage engine and then,
                  to parse the state before setting it to undefined and clean each storage state key.

                      const appReducer = combineReducers({
                      /* your app's top-level reducers */
                      })

                      const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
                      if (action.type === 'USER_LOGOUT') {
                          Object.keys(state).forEach(key => {
                          storage.removeItem(`persist:${key}`)
                          })

                          state = undefined
                      }

                      return appReducer(state, action)
                      }

      <h3>Whats the purpose of at symbol in the Redux connect decorator?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  The @ symbol is in fact a JavaScript expression used to signify decorators.
                  Decorators make it possible to annotate and modify classes and properties at design time.

                      Let's take an example setting up Redux without and with a decorator.

                      Without decorator:

                          import React from 'react'
                          import * as actionCreators from './actionCreators'
                          import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux'
                          import { connect } from 'react-redux'

                          function mapStateToProps(state) {
                          return { todos: state.todos }
                          }

                          function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
                          return { actions: bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch) }
                          }

                          class MyApp extends React.Component {
                          // ...define your main app here
                          }

                          export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyApp)

                      With decorator:

                          import React from 'react'
                          import * as actionCreators from './actionCreators'
                          import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux'
                          import { connect } from 'react-redux'

                          function mapStateToProps(state) {
                          return { todos: state.todos }
                          }

                          function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
                          return { actions: bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch) }
                          }

                          @connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)
                          export default class MyApp extends React.Component {
                          // ...define your main app here
                          }

                      The above examples are almost similar except the usage of decorator.
                      The decorator syntax isn't built into any JavaScript runtimes yet, and is still experimental and subject to change.
                      You can use babel for the decorators support.

      <h3>What is the difference between React context and React Redux?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        You can use Context in your application directly and is going to be
        great for passing down data to deeply nested components which what it
        was designed for.<br />

        Whereas Redux is much more powerful and provides a large number of
        features that the Context API doesn't provide.<br />
        Also, React Redux uses context internally but it doesn't expose this
        fact in the public API.
      </div>

      <h3>Why are Redux state functions called reducers?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  Reducers always return the accumulation of the state (based on all previous and current actions).
                  Therefore, they act as a reducer of state. Each time a Redux reducer is called, the state and action are passed as parameters.
                  This state is then reduced (or accumulated) based on the action, and then the next state is returned.
                  You could reduce a collection of actions and an initial state (of the store) on which to perform these actions to get the resulting final state.

      <h3>How to make AJAX request in Redux?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  You can use redux-thunk middleware which allows you to define async actions.

                  Let's take an example of fetching specific account as an AJAX call using fetch API:

                      export function fetchAccount(id) {
                          return dispatch => {
                              dispatch(setLoadingAccountState()) // Show a loading spinner
                              fetch(`/account/${id}`, (response) => {
                              dispatch(doneFetchingAccount()) // Hide loading spinner
                              if (response.status === 200) {
                                  dispatch(setAccount(response.json)) // Use a normal function to set the received state
                              } else {
                                  dispatch(someError)
                              }
                              })
                          }
                      }

                      function setAccount(data) {
                          return { type: 'SET_Account', data: data }
                      }

      <h3>Should I keep all component's state in Redux store?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Keep your data in the Redux store, and the UI related state internally
        in the component.
      </div>

      <h3>What is the proper way to access Redux store?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        The best way to access your store in a component is to use the
        connect() function, that creates a new component that wraps around
        your existing one. This pattern is called Higher-Order Components, and
        is generally the preferred way of extending a component's
        functionality in React. This allows you to map state and action
        creators to your component, and have them passed in automatically as
        your store updates.
        <pre><code>

                  Let's take an example of "FilterLink" component using connect:

                      import { connect } from 'react-redux'
                      import { setVisibilityFilter } from '../actions'
                      import Link from '../components/Link'

                      const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
                      active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter
                      })

                      const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({
                      onClick: () => dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter))
                      })

                      const FilterLink = connect(
                      mapStateToProps,
                      mapDispatchToProps
                      )(Link)

                      export default FilterLink

                  Due to it having quite a few performance optimizations and generally being less
                  likely to cause bugs, the Redux developers almost always recommend using connect() over accessing the store directly (using context API).

                      class MyComponent {
                          someMethod() {
                              doSomethingWith(this.context.store)
                          }
                      }

      <h3>
        What is the difference between component and container in React Redux?
      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Component is a class or function component that describes the
        presentational part of your application.<br />
        Container is an informal term for a component that is connected to a
        Redux store.<br />
        Containers subscribe to Redux state updates and dispatch actions, and
        they usually don't render DOM elements; they delegate rendering to
        presentational child components.
      </div>

      <h3>What is the purpose of the constants in Redux?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Constants allows you to easily find all usages of that specific
        functionality across the project when you use an IDE.<br />
        It also prevents you from introducing silly bugs caused by typos – in
        which case, you will get a ReferenceError immediately.
        <pre><code>
                  Normally we will save them in a single file (constants.js or actionTypes.js).

                      export const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'
                      export const DELETE_TODO = 'DELETE_TODO'
                      export const EDIT_TODO = 'EDIT_TODO'
                      export const COMPLETE_TODO = 'COMPLETE_TODO'
                      export const COMPLETE_ALL = 'COMPLETE_ALL'
                      export const CLEAR_COMPLETED = 'CLEAR_COMPLETED'

                  In Redux, you use them in two places:

                      1. During action creation:

                          Let's take actions.js:

                          import { ADD_TODO } from './actionTypes';

                          export function addTodo(text) {
                              return { type: ADD_TODO, text }
                              }

                      2. In reducers:

                      Let's create reducer.js:

                      import { ADD_TODO } from './actionTypes'

                      export default (state = [], action) => {
                          switch (action.type) {
                              case ADD_TODO:
                              return [
                                  ...state,
                                  {
                                  text: action.text,
                                  completed: false
                                  }
                              ];
                              default:
                              return state
                          }

      <h3>What are the different ways to write mapDispatchToProps()?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  There are a few ways of binding action creators to dispatch() in mapDispatchToProps().

                  Below are the possible options:

                      const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
                          action: () => dispatch(action())
                      })

                      const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
                          action: bindActionCreators(action, dispatch)
                      })

                      const mapDispatchToProps = { action }

                      The third option is just a shorthand for the first one.

      <h3>
        What is the use of the ownProps parameter in mapStateToProps() and
        mapDispatchToProps()?
      </h3>
      <div class="answer">
        If the ownProps parameter is specified, React Redux will pass the
        props that were passed to the component into your connect
        functions.<br />
        So, if you use a connected component:
        <pre><code>
                      import ConnectedComponent from './containers/ConnectedComponent';

                      &lt;ConnectedComponent user={'john'} /&gt;

                  The ownProps inside your mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps() functions will be an object:

                      { user: 'john' }

                  You can use this object to decide what to return from those functions.

      <h3>How to structure Redux top level directories?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Most of the applications has several top-level directories as below:
        <pre><code>
                      1. Components: Used for dumb components unaware of Redux.
                      2. Containers: Used for smart components connected to Redux.
                      3. Actions: Used for all action creators, where file names correspond to part of the app.
                      4. Reducers: Used for all reducers, where files name correspond to state key.
                      5. Store: Used for store initialization

                  in React/Redux applications easier and better.

        paused and cancelled from the main application with normal Redux
        actions,<br />

                      Both call() and put() are effect creator functions. call() function is used to create

                      an effect, which instructs middleware to dispatch an action to the store.

                      Let's take example of how these effects work for fetching particular user data.

                          function* fetchUserSaga(action) {
                              // `call` function accepts rest arguments, which will be passed to `api.fetchUser` function.

        effects.<br />
        In most of the scenarios, Thunk uses Promises to deal with them,
        whereas Saga uses Generators.<br />
        Thunk is simple to use and Promises are familiar to many developers,
        Sagas/Generators are more powerful but you will need to learn them.<br />
        But both middleware can coexist, so you can start with Thunks and
        introduce Sagas when/if you need them.

      <h3>What is Redux DevTools?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Redux DevTools is a live-editing time travel environment for Redux
        with hot reloading, action replay, and customizable UI.<br />
        If you don't want to bother with installing Redux DevTools and
        integrating it into your project, consider using Redux DevTools
        Extension for Chrome and Firefox.

      <h3>What are the features of Redux DevTools?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Some of the main features of Redux DevTools are below,
        <pre>
                  <code>
                          1. Lets you inspect every state and action payload.
                          2. Lets you go back in time by cancelling actions.
                          3. If you change the reducer code, each staged action will be re-evaluated.
                          4. If the reducers throw, you will see during which action this happened, and what the error was.
                          5. With persistState() store enhancer, you can persist debug sessions across page reloads.

      <h3>What are Redux selectors and why to use them?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre>
                  <code>
                      Selectors are functions that take Redux state as an argument and return some
                      data to pass to the component.

                      For example, to get user details from the state:

                          const getUserData = state => state.user.data

                      These selectors have two main benefits,

                       - The selector can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state
                       - The selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes

      <h3>What is Redux Form?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Redux Form works with React and Redux to enable a form in React to use
        Redux to store all of its state.<br />
        Redux Form can be used with raw HTML5 inputs, but it also works very
        well with common UI frameworks like Material UI, React Widgets and
        React Bootstrap.

      <h3>How Relay is different from Redux?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre>
                  <code>
                      Relay is similar to Redux in that they both use a single store.
                      The main difference is that relay only manages state originated from the server,
                      and all access to the state is used via GraphQL queries (for reading data) and mutations
                      (for changing data). Relay caches the data for you and optimizes data fetching for you,
                      by fetching only changed data and nothing more.

      <h3>What is an action in Redux?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Actions are plain JavaScript objects or payloads of information that
        send data from your application to your store.<br />
        They are the only source of information for the store.<br />
        Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action
        being performed.<br />
        For example, let's take an action which represents adding a new todo
        item:
        <pre><code>
                      {
                          type: ADD_TODO,

      <h4>ReactJS Questions - React Router</h4>

      <h3>What is React Router?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        React Router is a powerful routing library built on top of React that
        helps you add new screens and flows to your application incredibly
        quickly, all while keeping the URL in sync with what's being displayed
        on the page.
      </div>

      <h3>How React Router is different from history library?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        React Router is a wrapper around the history library which handles
        interaction with the browser's window.history with its browser and
        hash histories. It also provides memory history which is useful for
        environments that don't have global history, such as mobile app
        development (React Native) and unit testing with Node.
      </div>

      <h3>What are the &lt;Router> components of React Router v4?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>

              React Router v4 provides below 3 &lt;Router> components:

                  &lt;BrowserRouter>
                  &lt;HashRouter>
                  &lt;MemoryRouter>

              The above components will create browser, hash, and memory history instances.
              React Router v4 makes the properties and methods of the history instance associated with your router available through the context in the router object.
          </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>What is the purpose of push() and replace() methods of history?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
              A history instance has two methods for navigation purpose.

              1. push()
              2. replace()

              If you think of the history as an array of visited locations, push() will add a new location
              to the array and replace() will replace the current location in the array with the new one.

          </code></pre>
      </div>

      <h3>How do you programmatically navigate using React Router v4?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
          There are three different ways to achieve programmatic routing/navigation within components.

              1. Using the withRouter() higher-order function:

              The withRouter() higher-order function will inject the history object as a prop of the component. This object provides push() and replace() methods to avoid the usage of context.

              import { withRouter } from 'react-router-dom' // this also works with 'react-router-native'

              const Button = withRouter(({ history }) => (
              &lt;button
                  type='button'
                  onClick={() => { history.push('/new-location') }}
                  &gt;
                  {'Click Me!'}
              &lt;/button&gt;
              ))

              2. Using &lt;Route&gt; component and render props pattern:

              The &lt;Route&gt; component passes the same props as withRouter(), so you will be able to access the history methods through the history prop.

              import { Route } from 'react-router-dom'

              const Button = () => (
                  &lt;Route render={({ history }) => (
                  &lt;button
                    type='button'
                    onClick={() => { history.push('/new-location') }}
                    &gt;
                    {'Click Me!'}
                  &lt;/button&gt;
                )} /&gt;
              )

              3. Using context:

              This option is not recommended and treated as unstable API.

              const Button = (props, context) => (
                  &lt;button
                      type='button'
                      onClick={() => {
                      context.history.push('/new-location')
                      }}
                      &gt;
                      {'Click Me!'}
                  &lt;/button&gt;
              )

              Button.contextTypes = {
                history: React.PropTypes.shape({
                  push: React.PropTypes.func.isRequired
                })
              }

      </div>

      <h3>How to get query parameters in React Router v4?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
              The ability to parse query strings was taken out of React Router v4 because there have been user requests over the years to support different implementation. So the decision has been given to users to choose the implementation they like. The recommended approach is to use query strings library.

                  const queryString = require('query-string');
                  const parsed = queryString.parse(props.location.search);

              You can also use URLSearchParams if you want something native:

                  const params = new URLSearchParams(props.location.search)
                  const foo = params.get('name')

              You should use a polyfill for IE11.

      <h3>What are Pure Components?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
              React.PureComponent is exactly the same as React.Component except that it handles the shouldComponentUpdate() method for you.
              When props or state changes, PureComponent will do a shallow comparison on both props and state.
              Component on the other hand won't compare current props and state to next out of the box.
              Thus, the component will re-render by default whenever shouldComponentUpdate is called.

      <h3>Why you get "Router may have only one child element" warning?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>

              You have to wrap your Route's in a &lt;Switch&gt; block because &lt;Switch&gt; is unique in that it renders a route exclusively.

                  At first you need to add Switch to your imports:

                  import { Switch, Router, Route } from 'react-router'
                  Then define the routes within &lt;Switch&gt; block:

                  &lt;Router&gt;
                      &lt;Switch&gt;
                          &lt;Route {/* ... */} /&gt;
                          &lt;Route {/* ... */} /&gt;
                      &lt;/Switch>
                  &lt;/Router&gt;

      <h3>How to pass params to history.push method in React Router v4?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
              While navigating you can pass props to the history object:

                  this.props.history.push({
                  pathname: '/template',
                  search: '?name=sudheer',
                  state: { detail: response.data }
                  })

              The search property is used to pass query params in push() method.

      <h3>How to implement default or NotFound page?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
              A &lt;Switch&gt; renders the first child &lt;Route&gt; that matches. A &lt;Route&gt; with no path always matches.
               So you just need to simply drop path attribute as below

                  &lt;Switch&gt;
                      &lt;Route exact path="/" component={Home}/&gt;
                      &lt;Route path="/user" component={User}/&gt;
                      &lt;Route component={NotFound} /&gt;
                  &lt;/Switch&gt;

      </div>

      <h3>How to get history on React Router v4?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
          Below are the list of steps to get history object on React Router v4,

              1. Create a module that exports a history object and import this module across the project.

                  For example, create history.js file:

                  import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history'

                  export default createBrowserHistory({
                  /* pass a configuration object here if needed */
                  })

              2. You should use the &lt;Router&gt; component instead of built-in routers. Imported the above history.js inside index.js file:

                  import { Router } from 'react-router-dom'
                  import history from './history'
                  import App from './App'

                  ReactDOM.render((
                  &lt;Router history={history}&gt;
                      &lt;App /&gt;
                  &lt;/Router&gt;
                  ), holder)

              3. You can also use push method of history object similar to built-in history object:

                  // some-other-file.js
                  import history from './history'

                  history.push('/go-here')

      <h3>How to perform automatic redirect after login?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>

              The react-router package provides &lt;Redirect&gt; component in React Router.
              Rendering a &lt;Redirect&gt; will navigate to a new location.
              Like server-side redirects, the new location will override the current location in the history stack.

                  import React, { Component } from 'react'
                  import { Redirect } from 'react-router'

                  export default class LoginComponent extends Component {
                    render() {
                      if (this.state.isLoggedIn === true) {
                        return &lt;Redirect to="/your/redirect/page" /&gt;
                      } else {
                        return &lt;div>{'Login Please'}&lt;/div&gt;
                      }
                    }

      <h4>React Questions - Testing</h4>

      <h3>What is Shallow Renderer in React testing?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>
                  Shallow rendering is useful for writing unit test cases in React. It lets you render a component one level deep and assert facts about what its render method returns, without worrying about the behavior of child components, which are not instantiated or rendered.

                  For example, if you have the following component:

                      function MyComponent() {
                      return (
                          &lt;div&gt;
                              &lt;span className={'heading'}&gt;{'Title'}&lt;/span&gt;
                              &lt;span className={'description'}&gt;{'Description'}&lt;/span&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;
                      )
                      }

                  Then you can assert as follows:

                      import ShallowRenderer from 'react-test-renderer/shallow'

                      // in your test
                      const renderer = new ShallowRenderer()
                      renderer.render(&lt;MyComponent /&gt;)

                      const result = renderer.getRenderOutput()

                      expect(result.type).toBe('div')
                      expect(result.props.children).toEqual([
                          &lt;span className={'heading'}&gt;{'Title'}&lt;/span&gt;,

      <h3>What is TestRenderer package in React?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>

                  This package provides a renderer that can be used to render components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment. This package makes it easy to grab a snapshot of the platform view hierarchy (similar to a DOM tree) rendered by a ReactDOM or React Native without using a browser or jsdom.

                      import TestRenderer from 'react-test-renderer'

                      const Link = ({page, children}) => &lt;a href={page}&gt;{children}&lt;/a&gt;

                      const testRenderer = TestRenderer.create(
                          &lt;Link page={'https://www.facebook.com/'}&gt;{'Facebook'}&lt;/Link&gt;
                      )

                      console.log(testRenderer.toJSON())
                      // {
                      //   type: 'a',
                      //   props: { href: 'https://www.facebook.com/' },
                      //   children: [ 'Facebook' ]
                      // }

      <h3>What is the purpose of ReactTestUtils package?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        ReactTestUtils are provided in the with-addons package and allow you
        to perform actions against a simulated DOM for the purpose of unit
        testing.
      </div>

      <h3>What is Jest?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        Jest is a JavaScript unit testing framework created by Facebook based
        on Jasmine and provides automated mock creation and a jsdom
        environment. It's often used for testing components.
      </div>

      <h3>What are the advantages of Jest over Jasmine?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        There are couple of advantages compared to Jasmine:<br />

        - Automatically finds tests to execute in your source code.<br />
        - Automatically mocks dependencies when running your tests.<br />
        - Allows you to test asynchronous code synchronously.<br />
        - Runs your tests with a fake DOM implementation (via jsdom) so that
        your tests can be run on the command line.<br />
        - Runs tests in parallel processes so that they finish sooner.<br />
      </div>

      <h3>Give a simple example of Jest test case ?</h3>
      <div class="answer">
        <pre><code>

                  Let's write a test for a function that adds two numbers in sum.js file:

                      const sum = (a, b) => a + b

                      export default sum

                  Create a file named sum.test.js which contains actual test:

                      import sum from './sum'

                      test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
                      expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3)
                      })

                  And then add the following section to your package.json:

                      {
                      "scripts": {
                          "test": "jest"
                      }
                      }

                  Finally, run yarn test or npm test and Jest will print a result:

                      $ yarn test
                      PASS ./sum.test.js
                      ✓ adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (2ms)
